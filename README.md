# Air pollution map

This project shows air pollution for Lubartow in Poland. Data about air condition has been scrapped from [here!](https://lubartow24.pl/)
using python script called *lubartow_air_polution_scrapper.py*.

To visualize data about air pollution I have used folium package. To install folium by pip
```
pip install folium
```
Or using conda
```
conda install -c conda-forge folium 
```
*Lubartow_air.csv* contains example dataset of air polution from one day.  
Result of this project you can see on this webpage [Lubartow air pollution map!](https://nieweglp.github.io/air_pollution_map/)
