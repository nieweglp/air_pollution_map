# Air polution map

This project shows air polution for Lubartow in Poland. Data about air condition has been scrapped from [here!](https://lubartow24.pl/)
using python script called *lubartow_air_polution_scrapper.py*.

To visualize data about air pollution I have used folium package. To install folium by pip
```
pip install folium
```
Or using conda
```
conda install -c conda-forge folium 
```
